# Target Direction Pointer

A [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) module that draws directional arrows on the border of your token pointing toward each of your targets.

## Features

- **Directional arrows** on your token's border, one per target
- **Relationship-based coloring**: red for hostile ↔ friendly, teal for friendly ↔ friendly, yellow for hostile ↔ hostile or ambiguous
- **Arrow width scales** with source token size
- **Arrow length scales** with distance to target
- **Opacity falloff** — distant targets fade out
- **Self-target indicator** — a centered ring when targeting your own token
- **GM "show all" mode** — see targeting arrows on every player's character token
- **Subtle breathing animation** — gentle pulse (configurable or disable)
- **Keyboard toggle** — no default binding; assignable in Configure Controls
- **Fully configurable** — every parameter adjustable in Module Settings


![Hostile token targeting](assets/hostile-source.png)

*Hostile token targeting friendly and hostile tokens. Red toward friendlies, yellow toward the other hostile.*

![Friendly targeting friendly](assets/ally-source-ally-target.png)

*Friendly token targeting other friendly tokens. Arrows are teal.*

![GM show-all mode](assets/gm-mode.png)

*GM view with "Show All" enabled. Arrows visible on multiple tokens at once.*
